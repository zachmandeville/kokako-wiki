<!--Title: API Overview -->

# What it is

API is like a trading language, an agreement between two digital parties about how to exchange information.  It's not so much a programming style, or function to learn...It's a contract to be able to pass over and understand the nuance of.  It's learning to speak in the way this other digital party is asking you to speak, so you can more freely share data.

# Where it's used

It's used when you want to access a database that is not necessarily stored on yoru computer.  It may be yr own data that you're storing somewhere 'in the cloud'.  Or it can be some other program's data that is being offered to the wider world, and which you want to integrate into yr own program.  

So, if you are wanting to make a minimal twitter client, that only shows a tweet at a time...you can build the client for that but you aren't going to rebuild twitter just to have a diff. interface.  Instead, you'll  use twitter's API to grab their storage of tweets, and bring them to yr client to show.
