<!--Title: Breakout on Open Source -->
<!--Subtitle: What it mean and how we join -->

# New Model of Ownership
- There's instead a shared fairness.  We are all looking at the rules and makings together, and working together to make us safer and better.
- Interesting talk about the notion of ownership  in open source, and morality and ethics:

# Boundaries of Open Source
- MIT License: You can use my code in however you like, but if you break it that's on you.
- GNU: you cannot own this after you write it.  The Free/Libre model.

# The General Concept
- Sort of what the patent office _should_ have been. 
- Bringing back the concept that the idea and the execution should be closer linked.  
- If society as a whole is the sum of all our learnings to date, how would it be decided what learnings I can and cannot use?
- It also puts forward a notion that we don't need to all be working on the same thing.  What incredible things could be accomplished if we share the unique things we are working on, to not have to work through and come up with our own version of that.  In the same way, you can also build upon an existing idea to make it better, or customize it in some new fashion.
# How to be Supported in Open Source
- Often you'll be supported by a company that needs you to keep it maintained as they use your software for their own thing.
- There are also groups that collect money and redistribute it to open source projects that are pivotal to that groups mission (mozilla does this somewhat, or a group that ross mentioned that's ruby supporters who want to make sure pivotal ruby projects are funded)

# How to Contribute

One way:
- Find a  repo you like on github (or somewhere else)
- Fork this repo and clone the fork to your local machine.
- Make your changes there on your local and push to your fork.
- Make a pull request from the fork to the original repo.

Another:
- Small contributions to the README or other documentation.
- Triage issues being raised.  Label them to make them easier to manage (which part of the app is the issue in relation to, for example.)
- Fix issues if you find them and can or improve the description/diagnosis of these issues.

Where to Start:
Your own package.json.  Look at the things you depend upon and see if you can help them stay up to date.

# Value Creation versus Extraction
# Cool Examples
# The Idea (the boundaries, where it starts and ends)
# Local Examples

# Revolutionary Potential
- There are people who are _building_ and maintaining the tools that make everything else work, and you can be on a first-name basis with them.
