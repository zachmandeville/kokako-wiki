<!-- TITLE: Math Programming And Gossip -->

# Write code like it's the most dramatic soap opera

Programming is often said to be mathematical, and to learn programming is to learn a lot of math.
I think this is true, but I also think we have too rigid of a view of math.  We are all doing *a lot*
of math constantly.  

Mathematical though, to me, is the ability to hold abstract notions in your head and manipulate them
abstractly.  So you'd do this with 4 + 5 = 9 but you'd also do it with feeding yourself:
`+`I am currently hungry, and the time is 10am.  
`+` I like burgers and falafel.  
`+` falafel is open 12 to 6 while burgers are open 9 to 6.  
`ergo` that means i'm in the range of hours for a burger and i'ma go get one now!

In the same way, gossip is a form of math.  you are holding complex relationships and calculi of the heart
to simulate scenarios and hodl your friends relationships in balance in your head. 

What happens when we broaden our understanding of the word "math", and use that broader
understanding to how we program.  What if we treat functions as characters in a soap opera?
