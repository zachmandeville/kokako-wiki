<!-- Title: Being Curious -->

I really liked how mix and piet worked through a file they didn't know.  They checked the package.json to see what the system would be using, then ran through files based on curiosity, and marked things they didn't know with //?  so they could find these later and answer them.  

They also broke things intentionally to confirm hypotheses.  it was exploratory far before trying to solve any problem.
