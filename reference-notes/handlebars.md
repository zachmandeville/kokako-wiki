<!-- Handlebars -->

# Summary

Handlebars is a templating language that can be implemented in many diff programming languages (like javascript and c++ or whatever).  It is implemented with node using `express-handlebars`.

It allows you to set templates that wait for data, that you can then fill in through your server side rendering.
