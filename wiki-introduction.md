# The Wiki 
A wiki is the practice of manifesting realities through a magical act of visualization.  I know this is woo woo, but woo woo 
  1.) Is the only way I really know how to speak and 
  2.) best captures what makes wikis powerful.

The best introductory practice to a wiki is: think upon something you do not know, visualize the answer, then announce your intention to receive this answer by creating a wiki page.  This ritual sets up a space to receive this knowledge, and in this space we will build the future you want, together.

## Aren't Wiki's documentation?

Documentation is a good side-effect of a wiki, but it is not the goal of one. Or, in other words, the wiki is not a "collaborative help page".  This may sound strange, as the common notion of a wiki is a big repository of information.  This common notion says that you write a page only if you have useful info about it, with the power of the wiki being that others can correct your typos or update the page if any part of it changes.

The problem with this notion is that it puts the emphasis on the end-product-- you add to a wiki when you already know a thing.  The real power, and magic, of a wiki comes when it is used at the _beginning_, when you invoke the receiving of knowledge for things you do not yet know.

# An Introductory Practice

## Think of something you'd like to know and use
*   This can be anything, but perhaps the most useful would be some subject that makes you say, "I would like to be able to use this knowledge, and help others know how to use this." 
*   For example: I want to know how the command-line command rsync works.  I heard it's great for pushing to remote servers, and think I could use it for my personal site.
## Start a new Wiki Page with an empowering title
*   At the moment when you _don't_ know how a thing works is when you should make a wiki page for it.  The title you give should relate to where you want to _go_, not where you are now.
*   For my page, I would title it "rsync: what it is and how to use it."
*   This page is going to be empty, of course, and that's great!  I have put something forward in the world that is inviting knowledge to come to it--and that knowledge will one day come.
## Structure this page around what you'd like to know, using headers.**
* Now you have the start of a page, invite some more knowledge by naming the things you will soon know.  This also helps structure the page for others (or future you) to fill out.
* For example, with rsync, I want to know what it is, how to use it, example commands for it, and where I can learn more.  Those become my headers:
	* Background
	* Usage
	* Examples
	* More Resources
* Now I have a basic structure for my investigation, and others who want to help know the questions we are seeking answers for.
## Let the Magic Happen
*  Now that you've posed this want to the world, you can be in a state of empowered reception.
*  The page with all the ansers you want now exists, it just needs to be fleshed out.  So as I start to research rsync more, I'll place the answers I found into this wiki page.  Slowly, I'll find a body of knowledge building up around me.
*  This is also where the collaboration starts to come in.  Perhaps there is someone who knows the rsync command real well, and is on this same wiki.  They fill out the example usages, and the next time I log in I find all these helpful answers.
*  As your page begins to fill, you may find yourself with new questions,a nd new subjects you'd like to know.  These become their own wiki pages, with the same practice around them.  And so, in the same way, our body of knowledge grows together as does our passion for exploration.

# Further Practices
## Help fill out pages written by others
* As you navigate this wiki, you may find some subject you're passionate about, but doesn't have much filled out in it yet.  This is an invitation to share your passion!  Help your cohort and build up our knowledge together.
## Add awesome info you discover during this course.
*   Perhaps you heard or discovered something during class that didn't really beg a question from you, but you still found _super_ cool.  Make a wiki page for it, and add it!  
*   This page can be small, literally just that snippet you found and liked.  That snippet is an invitation to grow, so just putting it there is putting something awesome in motion.  You never know when you'll want to find this later, or when it'll help someone else.
## Link Pages together.
*  We have the full beautiful power of hypertext at our disposal.  Let's use it!  If you find an article that could be helped by some other page in the wiki, then you can link them with that good hypertext.  This helps us grow our mesh of questions, answers, and other interests.

# Key Values
## The wiki, and all of it's pages, will never be 'finished'.**
*  We will have empty pages, incomplete information, and dead links.  This is good!  That means we are doing things right.  The wiki is a tool of exploration, as much as it is one of archiving.  The empty pages are paths we've yet to go down, questions whose answers we've yet to discover.  Without them, it means we haven't even discovered the questions yet.
## A wiki is a practice, not a product.
*   While the wiki will create an incredible resource that we can always return to, it's primary magic comes from using it, of adding new slim pages to it, of refining the existing pages.  In this, you can see the wiki as a navigation tool--continually inviting you to travel further into the unknown, documenting each step you took for others to follow.  The value we get from reading it later is a side-effect and not the point.
*   For example, I am writing this now not to explain things for you, but because it better helps me articulate a misty notion for myself.
*   This can be a bit hard to express, but can be felt quite easy. So just dive in!
## Y'all are awesome.
* This isn't _directly_ related to the wiki, but it is true and you should know!
