# Server Side Rendering Metaphor

Imagine your template as a paint by numbers painting.  You have a sky with number 1, a sun with number 2, an ocean with number 3, and an umbrella with number 1.  Each of these are bits of data you could then change with data.  Say: "All 1's should be green" would render the painting with a green sky and green umbrella.

In the same way, we have a template waiting for data input, and the "1 should be green" is the data we are feeding in.
