**[A Prehistory of the Cloud, by Tung Hui-Hu](https://coolguy.website/library/a-prehistory-of-the-cloud.html)**
An incredible collage about the political/artistic history of the internet--and the geographic space in which the 'cloud' resides.

**[Code, by Charles Petzold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code)**
A patient, and elucidating walk through how the computer works--starting at the most basic signals and moving up.  Weirdly readable.

**[AdvancED CSS, by Meitar Moscovitz and Joe Louis](https://www.amazon.com/AdvancED-CSS-Joe-Lewis/dp/1430219327)**
Best resource on CSS I've ever found.  Shows how much incredible things you can do with _just_ css.
