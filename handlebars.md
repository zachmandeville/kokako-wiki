Looks like handlebars on the side
https://handlebarsjs.com/
Use handlebars to serve up content using a template
# Handlebars template

## res.render(__dirname + '/folder/filename')
for rendering a file/template that you have alsready created. 

## Repeating Pattern
- Get some data and put it in an object
- pass that object to res.render
- modify the .hbs template to make use of the data
