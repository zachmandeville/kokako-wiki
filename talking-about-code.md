<!-- Title: Talking about Code -->
<!-- Subtitle: Ways we can talk about code to better collaborate.  -->

# Purpose of this page.
We are doing a lot of paired programming, which means someone without a keyboard is trying to tell someone else what to do with their keyboard.  It is easy to get hung up on _how_ to communicate what you'd like to try, and this means you don't get to focus on the problem or project at hand.  This page is intended to collect useful tips for how we talk to each other about our code.

# Tips
## Use Line Numbers
Every line of code is on a _specific_ line, and that line is marked in our text editor.  So when referring to a part of the code you'd like to change, the most specific way you can point to it is with the number.  So instead of "We aren't calling the cool function properly." You can say, "On line 20, the cool function is missing a closing parenthesis.
## Surround is a useful verb with HTML
HTML works by surrounding a body of text with a signifier that tells the browser how to structure and display that text.  So, if I'm making a page called "My Good Ass Website" and I want that titlte big and bold at the top of the page, then I might write:
`<h1>My Good Ass Website
# Shared Language!
