# What it is!
https://heroku.com

Heroku helps you deploy your app so it is accessible to the larger world.  So far we've been making apps that run on our local device.  With Heroku, we can run our servers and apps but accessible from a browser anywhere.

# Why we use Heroku
- Fairly Simple to use.
- You can host 5 sites with them _for freeeeee_.

# Using Heroku

## Command Line Tool
There is a command line tool that helps you check on your site, and offers many useful commands!
You can install it here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

### Useful Command line tool commands

`heroku apps`
Will list all the apps you have hosted on heroku

`heroku create {name of your app}`
Will create a new app, hosted on heroku at name-of-your-app.herokuapp.com

`heroku logs`
Will list the logs on your server (so if you entered console.logs they'd appear here)

`heroku auth:logout`
Logs you out. important! !! !
