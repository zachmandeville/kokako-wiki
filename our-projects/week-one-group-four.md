# Our Values
- Everyone is heard.  
  - Ask someone if they aren't speaking much if they are being heard.
  - No question is a stupid question.
  - Whoever has anything of value to add, should feel free to do it or speak it.
- We ask questions. 
- We work together, always.  All code is done as pair programming.
- We voice our intentions at the start of work
  - Be explicit at the beginning with how you want to work at that  moment. 
  - Communicating at big points.  Coming to the keyboard, commiting, pushing.
- No harm is ever intended. We trust each other.
- We empower each other and others.
- We embrace failure.  This is a learning session. 
- We Embrace positivity.
- We Document what we do and what we learned.

# How we Work Together
- Communicate often, and be explicit with intentions and expectations when starting session.
- We will switch partners at coordinated times, so we are all working together.
- Work with issues and waffle.io, to coordinate our tasks. 
- Work with user stories.
- Find the time ask questions, so we _all_ understand how the code works.  If we collevitvely know why the app is broken is far better than if  only one of us understands why it works.

# Week One: Group Four

# Meeting Notes
- Set up values and working practices.
