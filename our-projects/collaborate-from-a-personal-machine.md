# Background
If you are wanting to help work with our code, you'll need to make sure you have all the right tools installed on your computer.  Here's what we use!

# Make sure you have the node tools installed.
### First off you need node!
* You can check with `node -v` (which means node --version).  You should get something like `v9.2.1`
	* If you don't get this, you need to install node.  Youc an do this by following the instructions at: https://nodejs.org
### Make sure you have yarn
* Check to see with `yarn -v` and you should get something like `1.5.1`
	* If you get no response, download and ionstall yarn using the instructions at:  https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
### Clone The Repo
`git clone https://github.com/Kokako-2018/meowtown2.git`

Then enter the directory with `cd meowtown2`

And now you are essentially good!
