<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Meowtown 2 -->

# The Summary of our App
We offer a custom-curated list of sweet-as animals to help give you a break during stressful coding sessions.

# User Stories
Tips for writing user stories:
- Say who the point of the story is for, what it is they'd like to do, and why they'd like to do it.  
- For example" As a user, I can see a homepage when i visit meowtown2.com, so I can know I am on the right site."
- Allow for creativity, do not be too specific in the story.  The context of why someone is asking for a thing is more important than whether it's a dropdown or whatever.  
		- in other words, we dont' care how it's implemented as long as the user can now do the thing they'd like to do.
- these are not features, these are stories about abilities we are now enabling for our users.
## Our User Stories 
* **As a user, I can customize the types of animals I want to see, so I get a personalized selection of photos.**
* **As a user browsing through my photos, I can select when I am done so I can return to the grind.**
* **As a user, I will see one photo at a time, and can click "next" to see the next one.**
# Our MVP
By combinging these initial user stories with our summary, we have a working description of an MVP(minimum viable product):

**"With Meowtown2, someone can visit our site during a break from coding, put in some simple criteria for the type of animals they'd like to see, then click through a selection of photos that match that criteria.  When they feel appropriately calmed, they can end their session and get back to coding."**

# Stretch stories
If we can do these things, once the mvp is done, it'd be awesome!
**As a user, I can choose from a variety of options beyond just species.**
**As a user, I can submit my own animal photos, with descriptors.**
