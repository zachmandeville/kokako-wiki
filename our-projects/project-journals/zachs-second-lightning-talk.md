<!-- Subtitle: Hacker poet and beautiful person -->

Head of digital policy for Taiwan, a 'digital minister'.  

Living a poetic life, using a poetic language to write poetry.  I don't fully understand the technical side, but love the hints of the world it's describing.

--From her medium article -- “Isn’t the government for everyone?” In response, four hackers participating in the Yahoo! Hackathon — @clkao, @tkirby, @ca, and @opop — built a citizen auditing system for the central government budget, making the Accounting and Statistics Office data intuitively interactive so that the public could grade and comment on every budget item. The technology that behind this public display was provided by OpenSpending, a project jointly maintained by a 76-country open data community.

--gOv started making mirrorish sites of government documents, but now editable and viewable and more interactive.  They were making the public more informed through smart code.  'why is nobody doing this?"  be that nobody who _is doing something.

n the PgREST — Node.js in the Database presentation, Audrey Tang used the MoeDict’s development process to illustrate a “full-stack, no-middleware” paradigm that unifies “distributed databases, spreadsheets, collaborative documents, front-end, back-end, and mobile app development” using the same set of tools, significantly reducing the entry barrier for non-specialist web developers.  - g0v.asia/tw

'patch the government' 'fork the government'  in both cases, the emphasis is on 'doing' something instead of just asking for someone else to do it for you.  The inherent message in this is that _you_ have the power to do this thing, the governemtn does not have this power over you.  You enacting the change for the gov't is really, then, helping others after yrself as you hd the power all along.

Excitement outside of Silicon valley.  I am a centralized american--America is not where the future happens.

Audrey Tang advocates for VR as a way to make government and civic duties more accessbile.  Create a space where everyone can enter, where peoplea re not judged by physical appearance, wher eyou can create huge experiences to walk through as part of your discussion, and where soeone can join the meeting later, and _walk through it_ experiencing it as it happened (instead of just watching a youtube video).  This is fucking cool.  AND she is advocating this for Taiwan as it has a large software industry now, who is working on VR, and so it's a good opportunity for Taiwan.I just love that this awesome thought is coming from there.

Living a poetic life.  

Is excited about the future of programming, and computers, but not to create sad dystopian worlds where we are all tied into one big machine and eating cream sauce all day.  She's excited for the future of code where we can connect beter as humans. 

For example, she uses VR extensively, but one of her projects in VR was to lead classes with students, where every avatar was the same height.  It is great to enter a virtual world, and it's great to be in many places at once but gathering over a coputer, but the big thing was she made all the avatars the same height.  Now, using the power of computers, the kids could be the same heigh as their teacher, and speak to the teacher without the physical fear of having to look up to them.  I find this v. beautiful.

encouraged a space of awe.  Her intention with VR is to create awe.  Not control, not a new market opportunity.  Equality and awe.

When we see “internet of things”, let’s make it an internet of beings.
When we see “virtual reality”, let’s make it a shared reality.
When we see “machine learning”, let’s make it collaborative learning.
When we see “user experience”, let’s make it about human experience.
When we hear “the singularity is near”, let us remember: the Plurality is here.


Tang joined the g0v project in 2012, and helped the hacker group to create “shadow” websites where the URL was one character different from official government websites.  But these websites displayed the information from those government departments in a more easily understood fashion using open source. - introductions necessary.com

    "I already loved math, and one day I came across programming books at home. I was immediately hooked by the logical and mathematical side, but I did not have a computer so I drew on sheets of paper. I pressed the buttons and wrote what the computer would have produced.
    
        So I learned programming without a machine. It is very educational : programing became right then a way of thinking.
	
her first program was an educational tool for her lil bro.

Born Autrijus.
