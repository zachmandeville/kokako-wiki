<!-- Title: How I made a feature to change the font on a site -->
<!-- Subtitle: Further explorations on DAT! -->

# The Site

<dat://4b9b475826314432f930122835130f298c4e333ad104a237e6ff38195334ffd1/>

# Step One: Add a new font file and check that I can successfully hardcode it into the CSS.

I added Hanken-light.ttf to the dat archive.  Next, change the CSS to match it!
