<!--Title: Zach's First Lightning Talk -->
<!--Subtitle: Import Export! -->

Today I will be talking about Import and Export.  These commands let you import elements from other files or modules to use in your code.  Y'all are likely already familiar with this, as it's a central concept for the style of module programming we do in node, with the require('such and such') function.  The difference is that require() came from node, while import and export are new standards added to the core Javascript language as part of ES6.

This last part is pretty significant, but to best explain the significance I think I first need to talk about literature, fan-fiction, and the sexual longings of Sherlock Holmes.

We write literature for it to be read.  This the great gift of sharing work, but it's also a type of trade-off.  Because it means that a piece of literature is inherently owned by multiple people--those who write it, and those who interpret it.

As a piece of literature grows in popularity and age, it can enter fully into the public sphere like a type of folklore--where people are aware of the _spirit_ of the writing more than any particular sentence.  It is this space in which fan-fiction lives.  In Fan-fiction, the fans of work re-interpret the central characters and concepts, introducing new stories or situations to better explore the nuances they interpret in these characters.  Head-canons emerge, entire cosmologies of relations never explicitly mentioned in the text, but that the reader is sure is there.  

For example: Sherlock Holmes.  The original texts were sharply plotted, and straightforward, texts about the detectice sherlock holmes solving mysteries with his friend Watson.  But as this literature was absored by it's readers, and the stories and characters hsared until they became a living thing, then the fans arose their own interpretation.  Sherlock _loves_ Watson.  A lot.  It's a noticable tension.  This fan's canon was explored to enough depth in fanfiction that it actually became part of hte standard canon, a noticable sexual tension in modern tellings of these characters. This was not necessarily in the original text, but the art of a thing can dissolve among the hpeople until it lives beyond it's original intent.

If Javascript is a language, then you can see all of the code written in it as the collected literature of that language.  A literature where functions, array,s and other concepts are the characters we interpret and create our own fan-theories upon.  

The original text is quite modest.  Javascript was created as a  marketing move, to make the browser Netscape Navigator stand out when it was released.  The look and syntax of JAvascript is based on Java, but mostly to help close a business deal.  The purpose of the language was to help make html more exciting, and interactive.  It could help you click on a box and make that box like jump up and down and stuff.

But when it was released to fans, they staretd to interpret the official canon in wholly new ways.  They saw Javascript as exteremely flexbile, and with far more possibilities than the original authors may have intended.  This world of fan interpretations bdcame stronger and more elaborate.

One fan, a person name Ky, wrote a fanfictiona bout Javascript that he called Node.  Node was JS but in an AU (alternate universe)  In this alternate universe, JS didn't just help  out an existing web-page.  Instead, it could build and be a server.  It could deploy webpages.  It could be more than an assistant, and act as the entire primary language of a web app.

Node was a popular fan interpretation of the characters in Javascript, and all the things that functions, arrays, promises could do.  Other developers started creating their own fan fictions based in the world of Node--one where javascript functions could become wonderful complex things, larger than just 1-2 lines.  and so they'd need to introduce a style of modular programming to better handle and arrange these complex structures.  From here arose require(), and module.exports---both aspects of Node that did not exist in core Javascript.  They were fan-theories of what javascript could do.

But on top of this, Node became such a popular fan interpreation that it entierely shifted the paradigm of what was possible.  so much taht when ES6 came out, it introduced that similar concept of modular code, of working on discrete segments that all depended upon and built off each other.  In other words, the fantheory was strong enough that it became the new living standard.

The benefits of import and export can be felt by y'all in like an hour, when your'e back on the floor and arranging your code in a clean, easy to understand and reuse and modify way.  But the main thing I'd want to say about htis all is: your imagination is powerful, and made manifest in code.  And hold on to your beautiful, unique thoughts.  Being persistent in your belief in how the world should be can end up being the thing the entire world adopts as standard.
