<!--Title: Week 6 Group 1 -->
#values
- Clear Wireframes and expectations for routes and such.
- Clear roles: who is working on what.
-  Being on an equal playing field.  Everyone is bringing their all.
- 
# Desired Emotions
- Challenged but relaxed.
- Not Stressed.
- Productive.
- With Purpose, knowing the next steps.
- No high expectations on any one person, or even us as a group. 

# What are our strengths?
- Zach: The conceptual framework for how the entire app works.  Communicating the larger technical picture.
- Rosie: Facilitating: keeping an eye on the time, what's the bottom line, where's everyone at and what are they feeling.  Keeping things on track so we achieve what we set out to achieve.
- Hameet: Adaptable.  Took well to sound functions and being open to learning new things.
- Dana: Looking after kanban--doing the task management to make sure we are keeping on the right track.
- Engie: A great filler.  If there's a role that needs to be done. but isn't being done, jumps in to fill that gap. Can see the larger picture for what the group needs, and keep that in balance without having to be asked.
- Annette: Good at getting on. Gets things done.  Amazing rubber ducky, able to talk through problems well and solve them together.  Great design sense. 

# What are Frustrations or Challenges we are having?
- Engie: Punctuality or lack of punctuality.  
- Annette: Lack of timeboxing on a tangent.  Going down a road that is interesting, but not relevant to the intention of the lecture or project.  
- Zach: Forking on a group project, when two pairs are working on same goal but taing wildly different paths cos they aren't talking to each other technically.
- Rosie: As we pair off, it's hard to stay aware of the dynamic of the whole group (or the whole cohort).  Lacking an ability to cohere as a whole group.
- Hameet: A challenge perhaps is when a pair diverges from intent of app, simply cos they didn't quite know how to do the task presented, did their best,. but came out with something different. No frustrations.
- Dana: The stress of not knowing what happens after bootcamp, or how exactly we'd stay together when school is done.

# Bubbles
- Sharing code snippets.
- Time app.
- Github repo as a circle.  As more commits happen ona  particular branch, the shape of the circle changes--becoming more jagged.  Trying to come back to a circle, through merging and returning to master and not going down wild branched paths. 
- Parking app, where parking is available.
- Timer app.  Able for a teacher to set a countdown timer for the next group that includes requirements for next thing (notebook, coffee, a chair).
- Anonymous emotional color provider--where you can see the current color of the entire group, or cohort--to see when it is shifting towards a color we should check in on (bright red means everyone is angry, purple means we are shifting towards bieng upset, etc.  A way to check in on where everyone's at, through not just words but feeeeeeeeelings.)
- Arisan: Bringing people together.  People pool in money for a gathering, and then randomly pick a person from the pool to host the event.  They can choose the theme and such, but everyonec oming comes with a reason for showing up (catching up, asking for help, sharing news, etc.)
