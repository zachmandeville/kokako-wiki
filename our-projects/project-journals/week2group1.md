- Trying to not do mob programming.

# Expectations
- All of us understand what we are building.  All of us understand what we made.
- In-the-Game Feedback.
- Don't be afraid of failure.
- Measure success by understanding, not by the product.
- We want to stretch ourselves.

# Our App
'gotadog.com' A dog-walking site that connects folks who want to walk dogs with folks who want their dogs walked.

# MVP
A person can access the page as either a walker or a dog owner.  When the walker logs in, they can see all dogs and basic details, and click 'request dog' to send an email to the dog owner.  The owner can check out the profile of the walker before they meet up.

# User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to select if I am an owner or walker, so I see the proper view of the site.
- As an owner, I want to be able to upload a photo of my dog and their details.
- As a walker, I want to be able to view the list of dogs who need walking, so I can pick one to walk.
- As a walker, I want to be able to send an email to the owner to request a meet up (to discuss walking the dog).
- As an owner, I can view the walker's profile to see their details prior to the meet up.
- As a walker, I'd like a link to my profile automatically added to the request email I send out.
- As an owner, I would like a 'dashboard view' where I can see who is walking my dog.
