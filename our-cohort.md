# The Cohort
## Annette
Annette has an infectious goofiness and humor that is so welcome on tiring days.  Her humor helps give a pep to the rest of the group!

I love Annika's straightforward feedback and comments around the code, it helps keep the exercises grounded and focused.

## Sam
On March 28, Sam troubleshooted my server and was able to quickly isolate, diagnose, and fix the problem.  I was back on my feet faster than expected and for that I will be forever grateful.
