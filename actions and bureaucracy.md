<!-- Title: Action Metaphors and Bureaucracy -->

action creators
actions
store
reducer

the notion of bureaucracy.

an action is just an object, n 'action creator' (the functions we create in actions/*.js) are beings that really know the proper way to format those action objects so they are accepted by the bureau of reducers.

**necessary complexity**

you add in those extra functions and those extra folders when the risk of typing something wrong affects too many things.  The complexity is necessary to make the whole machine you're building work smoothly.
