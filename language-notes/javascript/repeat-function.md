# Sometimes you want to repeat things!
Sometimes you want to repeat characters or strings (for example, printing 10 lines of blank space in a console log.)  

You can repeat strings. with the repeat function.  this takes a number for an argument, and that number determines how many times you repeat the string.   

For example let's say I wanted to print "fuck yah " 30 times.
This would be:
`console.log('fuck yah '.repeat(30))`
