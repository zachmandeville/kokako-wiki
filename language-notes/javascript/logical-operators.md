<!-- TITLE: Logical Operators -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Them Ands and ORs -->

# What they are and why we use them!
Logical operators allow us to use multiple requirements in our if statements and boolean values(and other statements things I havne't learned yet?)

The two big ones are AND and OR.

## AND &&
And is represented as `&&`   so a statement like:
`if (i < 5 && >2` would mean "I is less than five AND greater than 2".  In other words: 3 or 4.

## OR ||
Or is represented as `||` and so:
 `i <5 || >2` would mean "i is less than five OR greater than 2" which would be, basically, any positive number.
