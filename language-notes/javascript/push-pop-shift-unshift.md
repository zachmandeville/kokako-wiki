# The great array functions.
These array functions let us move items into and out of an array.

**Push
**
add an item to the end of an array.

**Pop **
remove the last item from an array (but this can be assigned elsewhere.  like you can say
`X=array.pop` and so X now equals the last item in the array.

**Shift**
Remove the first element from an array (like pop, but for firsts!)

**Unshift**
Like push, but for the first element.  Adds something to the beginning of an array.
