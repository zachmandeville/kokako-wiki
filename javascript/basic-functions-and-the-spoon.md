<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Basic Functions And The Spoon -->

# Background 
Whenever I would read up on some language, i'd get frustrated that they always started out so basic. *Here's how you can **add **a number, and **subtract** a number, and **times** a number, and make a variable a new number!* it felt condescending kinda?  Or it felt like they were going stupidly basic and that there was some better improved version of the thing I just learned that they'd tell me later.  So the early stages of programming feels like spinning your wheels and literally learning how to count again.

# But my New Thought!

But now that i've been doing it a bit more, I'm seeing that so much of this arithmetic stuff can be used in so many other ways.  it is a foundational aspect of programming and life.  the difference is that we know life, and internalized all the counting and arithmetic we do.  In programming we are in a completetly different tableau, with words made up for this world, and so we have to relearn how to express our own basic concepts within this wrold.

For example.  Imagine a spoon, and now imagine never seeing one before or having any concept for what it could do.  And so someone shows you that with a spoon you can scoop out some food and bring that bit of food into your mouth to eat. you now have the basic undersatnding of a spoon.  but then you realize that it's curve could also be used to trim off food, and not just scoop, or it could be used with another spoon to make perfect balls of food shapes.  or you can use it to measure food, or transfer food from one side to another.  Later, you are introduced to a ladle which is a brand new object, but makes sense because it reminds you of a spoon. ...and later you realize that food isn't necessary for a spoon, it can be a musical instrument too, or be balanced on your nose, or flipped around to better mix drinks, or used as a ruler, etc....

these beginning concepts feel v. much like a spoon to me.  I leaerned how to add two numbers together...but that basic concept can now help me make far more complex apps bdause i'm using that simple function in more and more creative ways.
