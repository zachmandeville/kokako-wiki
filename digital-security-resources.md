<!--Title: Digital Security Resources -->
<!--Subtitle: Useful Links around InfoSec -->

# Introduction

On May 5th, a section of the cohort got together for [HACKERDAY SATURDAY](http://solarpunk.cool/events/), an all-day infosecurity magical computer and movie funsesh.  There were a number of links referenced throughout, that I'd l ike to collect here!

## Persona Based Training Matrix

We started the day articulating the concerns we have around our own security, and who we see as 'threats' to that security.  Through this we were able to from a matrix in which to place ourselves, a context in which to decide what sort of security we, as individuals, need. This idea was based largely on the persona training matrix articulated here:

The _big_ thing I wanna emphasize is that there is no catch-all, one-size-fits-all solution.  All of this is a continual personal practice.  That linka above is not intended as an ultimate resource.  Please let me know if there's areas that you want to learn more about, and we can start to build up our own personalized resources too.  

## Password Managers

A great and immediate thing you can do to boost your online safety is to use a password manager.  They are great and simple to use and make logging into places mad convenient.  

I use lastpass, and think it's great.  You can find it in your firefox or chrome add-ons store.

Other good ones are 1password and keepassx (both also in the add-ons library).  

## Privacytools.io

Another great resource for building a healthier online presence can be found at [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io).  You can essentially run down this list and customize your own tools (browser, email, wifi, etc) with their advice.  Please remember that you don't need _everything_, you only need right now the things you can handle and that fit where you'd place yourself in the above matrix.

## Public private keys and PGP

We talked slightly of 'two-key encryption', which lies at the heart of many of the encrypted devices we use (like scuttlebutt, signal, or using ssh keys with your github repo).  It's also at the heart of using PGP with your emails.

Here is a pretty good overview of two-key encryption and PGP:

And here is a _great_ overview of why someone would want to use pgp emails in their own correspondence:

(at the bottom of this article are great links for setting up pgp for mac, linux, or pc)

side note: It's not just about encrypting a message.  The ability to _sign_ your messages is incredible for building trust and presence across these vast digital spaces. 

## Signal

Signal is a widely used, aesthetically familiar(and pleasing!) messenger app that is end-to-end encrypted.  This is a great way to communicate with your friends confidently and securely, knowing that the only person who can read your message is the one you sent it to.  You can download signal here:

https://whispersystems.org

Signal works just like any other messenger, and you can connect it to your address book using your phone number, so you can quickly find other friends also on signal.  In other words, there's no real reason _not_ to use it.  

We also talked about how it's not just about using signal, but verifying the safety numbers of yo ur friends on there.  That gives you the confidence that the person you are messaging is yr actual friend.  Swing by me if you wanna know how to verify and cannot quite figure it out!

## Room to Grow

I don't really wanna just list a bunch of thiongs here, as security is an evolving process and conversation, and not just a list to follow.  SO! if you wanna see more stuff, let's talk and add things together!
